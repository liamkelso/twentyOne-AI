    A simple environment for the counting game 21.
    - The state is a single integer representing the current count.
    - Actions: 0 means add 1, 1 means add 2.
    - The agent makes a move, then the opponent (a random agent) makes a move.
    - If the count reaches or exceeds 21, the game ends.
      The agent loses if it is responsible for reaching 21 or more.
      The agent wins if the opponent causes the count to reach 21 or more.
